# Desktop Hardware Assistant: Application Flow

## Overview

This document outlines the primary flows and interactions within the Desktop Hardware Assistant platform. The system operates as a modular, API-first platform that provides hardware management, compatibility checking, recommendations, and market analysis services.

## System Architecture Flow

The Desktop Hardware Assistant employs a microservices architecture with the following flow of information:

    DB->>Market: Watch list data
    Market->>Market: Detect price drops
    Market->>MessageBus: Publish price alert event
    MessageBus->>Webhooks: Forward alert event
    Webhooks->>User: Send price alert notification
```

## Data Flow

### Hardware Component Data Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    Input[User Input] --> Validation[Data Validation]
    Validation --> Processing[Data Processing]
    Processing --> Storage[Database Storage]
    Storage --> Retrieval[Data Retrieval]
    Retrieval --> Analysis[Data Analysis]
    Analysis --> Output[User Output]
    
    subgraph "Data Transformation"
        Validation
        Processing
    end

        Storage
        Retrieval
    end
    
    subgraph "Business Logic"
        Analysis
    end
```

## Integration Patterns

### Webhook Notification System

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Service as Internal Service
    participant MessageBus as RabbitMQ
    participant Webhook as Webhook Manager
    participant Client as External Client
    
    Service->>MessageBus: Publish event
    MessageBus->>Webhook: Forward event
    Webhook->>Webhook: Format payload
    Webhook->>Client: Send webhook POST
    Client->>Webhook: Acknowledge (200 OK)
    Webhook->>MessageBus: Mark as delivered
```

### Third-Party API Integration

```mermaid
graph TD
    Market[Market Service] --> PriceAPI[Price API Adapter]
    PriceAPI --> Retailers[Retailer APIs]
    
    Market --> ReleaseAPI[Release API Adapter]
    ReleaseAPI --> Manufacturers[Manufacturer APIs]
    
    subgraph "Adapter Layer"
        PriceAPI
        ReleaseAPI
    end
    
    subgraph "External Services"
        Retailers
        Manufacturers
    end
```

## Error Handling Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Gateway as API Gateway
    participant Service as Microservice
    participant ErrorHandler as Error Handler
    
    Client->>Gateway: Request
    Gateway->>Service: Forward request
    Service->>ErrorHandler: Error occurs
    ErrorHandler->>ErrorHandler: Log error
    ErrorHandler->>Service: Return error details
    Service->>Gateway: Error response
    Gateway->>Client: Formatted error
```

## Deployment Architecture Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    GitRepo[GitHub Repository] --> CI[CI/CD Pipeline]
    CI --> Build[Build Images]
    Build --> Test[Run Tests]
    Test --> Deploy[Deploy Services]
    
    Deploy --> APIGateway[API Gateway Container]
    Deploy --> InventoryService[Inventory Service Container]
    Deploy --> CompatibilityService[Compatibility Service Container]
    Deploy --> RecommendationService[Recommendation Service Container]
    Deploy --> MarketService[Market Service Container]
    
    subgraph "Docker Compose Environment"
        APIGateway
        InventoryService
        CompatibilityService
        RecommendationService
        MarketService
        MongoDB[MongoDB Container]
        RabbitMQ[RabbitMQ Container]
    end
```

## Scalability Considerations

Think of the system like a highway network:

- **Core API Gateway**: The main interchange that directs traffic to the correct roads
- **Microservices**: Specialized lanes for different types of vehicles (requests)
- **Message Bus**: Traffic lights and signs that coordinate movement
- **Database**: Parking structures where vehicles (data) can be stored and retrieved

As traffic increases:
- Additional lanes (service instances) can be added to busy routes
- New interchanges (load balancers) distribute traffic evenly
- Express lanes (caching) provide faster access for common routes

## Security Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    Request[API Request] --> Gateway[API Gateway]
    Gateway --> Auth[Authentication]
    Auth --> JWT[JWT Validation]
    JWT --> Scope[Permission Scope Check]
    Scope --> RateLimit[Rate Limiting]
    RateLimit --> Service[Microservice]
    
    subgraph "Security Layers"
        Auth
        JWT
        Scope
        RateLimit
    end
```

## Conclusion

This document outlines the key flows within the Desktop Hardware Assistant platform. Understanding these flows is essential for developers integrating with the system or extending its functionality. The modular architecture allows for flexible scaling and enhancement of individual components while maintaining the overall system integrity.
