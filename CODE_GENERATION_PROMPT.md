# Desktop Hardware Assistant API - Development Specification

## Project Overview

Create a comprehensive Desktop Hardware Assistant API that helps users manage, evaluate, and make decisions about desktop hardware components. The system should be designed as a modular, API-first platform that can be integrated with third-party applications, MCP servers, and AI orchestrators.

## Technical Requirements

- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Database: MongoDB
- Message Bus: RabbitMQ
- Authentication: JWT tokens
- Documentation: OpenAPI/Swagger

## System Architecture

Implement the following core components:

### 1. Core API Gateway
- Authentication and authorization service
- Rate limiting and request throttling
- Request routing to appropriate microservices
- Logging and monitoring

### 2. Microservices

#### 2.1 Hardware Inventory Service
- Store and manage user hardware components
- Track specifications, age, and performance metrics
- Provide CRUD operations for hardware inventory
- Implement component categorization (CPU, GPU, RAM, etc.)

#### 2.2 Compatibility Service
- Rules engine for hardware compatibility checking
- Validation logic for component combinations
- Identification of potential conflicts
- Provide compatibility scores and explanations

#### 2.3 Recommendation Service
- System bottleneck analysis
- Upgrade path suggestions based on budget constraints
- Performance improvement estimations
- Cost-effectiveness calculations

#### 2.4 Market Service
- Track component prices across retailers
- Monitor new hardware releases
- Historical price trend analysis
- Availability and stock alerts

### 3. Integration Layer
- RESTful API endpoints for all services
- GraphQL interface for complex queries
- Webhook system for event notifications
- Client SDKs/libraries for common programming languages

## API Endpoints

Implement the following key API endpoints (expand as needed):

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register`
- `POST /api/auth/login`
- `POST /api/auth/refresh`

### Hardware Inventory
- `GET /api/inventory`
- `POST /api/inventory/components`
- `GET /api/inventory/components/{component_id}`
- `PUT /api/inventory/components/{component_id}`
- `DELETE /api/inventory/components/{component_id}`

### Compatibility
- `POST /api/compatibility/check`
- `GET /api/compatibility/rules`

### Recommendations
- `GET /api/recommendations/upgrade`
- `POST /api/recommendations/simulate`
- `GET /api/recommendations/bottlenecks`

### Market
- `GET /api/market/prices/{component_type}`
- `GET /api/market/trends/{component_id}`
- `POST /api/market/alerts`

## Data Models

Define appropriate data models for:

1. User profiles
2. Hardware components (with appropriate fields for each component type)
3. System configurations
4. Compatibility rules
5. Price records
6. Recommendation results

## Integration Features

Implement the following integration capabilities:

1. Webhook system for real-time notifications
   - Price drops
   - Compatibility issues
   - New hardware releases
   - Recommended upgrades

2. Authentication tokens for third-party access
   - API key generation and management
   - Permission scopes and access control

3. Documentation
   - Interactive API documentation with Swagger UI
   - Code examples for common integrations
   - Rate limit information

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Use FastAPI's dependency injection for clean, testable code
2. Implement proper error handling and status codes
3. Use Pydantic models for request/response validation
4. Set up asynchronous processing for long-running tasks
5. Implement database migrations for schema changes
6. Use environment variables for configuration
7. Containerize the application with Docker
8. Set up MongoDB indexes for performance
9. Implement proper logging for debugging and monitoring
10. Write unit and integration tests for core functionality

## Project Structure

```

## Deployment Considerations

1. Containerize each microservice
2. Use Docker Compose for local development
3. Prepare for Kubernetes deployment
4. Implement health checks for each service
5. Set up monitoring and alerting
6. Plan for horizontal scaling of busy services

This specification outlines the core requirements for building a Desktop Hardware Assistant API. The implementation should follow modern best practices for API design, security, and scalability while maintaining a clean, modular architecture that facilitates integration with third-party systems.
